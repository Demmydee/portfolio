This little project is a random number game.

A player guesses what number the computer is going to display randomly between 1 and 10

To make it more fun, players can win or lose while playing this simple game.

Player will be asked to play with a certain amount, and stand a chance to win 2000% of the amount.

There will be 6 attempts, each failed attempt reduces the amount that can be won

I hope you enjoy it. Feedbacks on ways to improve it will be highly appreciated
